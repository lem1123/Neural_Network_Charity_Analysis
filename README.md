# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis - Challenge Number 19 

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to assist Alphabet Soup, a philanthropic organization with ensuring that the donations received and then given to organizations is used effectively.  As part of the analysis, we reviewed a large CSV file that contained data for donations received by Alphabet Soup.  We were then tasked with working through various machine learning models to achieve   

## Results

## Data Preprocessing

***

* What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

*** 

* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
